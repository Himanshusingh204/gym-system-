# Vajra Fitness - Enterprise Gym Management System

Vajra Fitness is a premium, production-ready SaaS application designed for gym owners in India. It provides a complete solution for managing multiple gyms, staff, trainers, and members with role-based access control and a modern, high-performance user interface.

## Features

### 1. Gym Management & Operations

- **Membership Plans**: Gym owners can create and assign diverse pricing tiers.
- **Membership Lifecycle**: `createMembership` / `renewMembership` with derived status (ACTIVE, EXPIRED, EXPIRING_SOON, etc.), plus a `syncExpiredMemberships` job that auto-expires overdue memberships.
- **Member Registration**: Gym-goers can register for specific branches, pending Admin approval.
- **Secure Onboarding**: Members and staff set their own password via one-time activation links; no default passwords. Forgot/reset-password flow included.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Strict JWT middleware routes separating Super Admins, Gym Admins, Trainers, Staff, and Members.
- **Fee Management**: Track member payments, dues, and overdue fees securely, with payment method / transaction ID / notes and PDF receipts.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Comprehensive daily check-ins for members and staff (duplicate check-ins blocked).
- **Workout Slips**: Trainers and Admins can assign custom digital workout plans to members.
- **PT Bookings**: Members book trainer sessions; trainers confirm/cancel/complete; gym admins manage all bookings.
- **Notifications**: In-app notification centre per user (bell, unread badge, mark read / mark all, delete).
- **Enquiry Management**: Track incoming gym leads (walk-in or online).

### 2. SaaS Platform

- **SaaS Plans & Gym Subscriptions**: Super Admins create monthly/yearly Vajra plans (member/trainer/staff limits, advanced reports) and assign them to gyms; gym owners see their subscription.
- **Reports**: Revenue report (JSON/CSV) and per-gym stats endpoints for gym admins.

## Demo / Default Credentials

These credentials are for **local development only** and must never be exposed on the public website, UI, or production builds.

| Role                              | Email / Username         | Password    | Source                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Super Admin                       | `admin@vajrafitness.com` | `admin123`  | `backend/scripts/seedSuperAdmin.ts`                               |
| Gym Admin (Iron Valley Gym)       | `owner@ironvalley.com`   | `gym123`    | `backend/scripts/seedGyms.ts`                                     |
| Gym Admin (PowerHouse Fitness)    | `owner@powerhouse.com`   | `gym123`    | `backend/scripts/seedGyms.ts`                                     |
| Gym Admin (Peak Performance Club) | `owner@peakclub.com`     | `gym123`    | `backend/scripts/seedGyms.ts`                                     |
| Member                            | (any created member)     | *(activation link)* | Gym admins generate a one-time activation link per member; the member sets their own password at `POST /auth/activate`. No default passwords are used. |

- The Super Admin is created by running `npx tsx scripts/seedSuperAdmin.ts` inside `backend/`.
- Approved demo gyms (with membership plans) are seeded by running `npx tsx scripts/seedGyms.ts` inside `backend/`.
- There are **no default member/staff passwords**. When a member or staff account is created, the API returns an `activationLink` (built from `FRONTEND_URL`) that the user opens to set their password. Forgot-password reset works the same way via `POST /auth/forgot-password` → `POST /auth/reset-password`.
- `backend/check-users.ts` and `backend/test-login.js` also reference the same Super Admin account for local debugging.
- In production, replace these defaults with randomly generated secrets and reset all seeded passwords.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL (or SQLite for local dev if configured)

### Environment Variables

**Backend (`backend/.env`)**

```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://vajra_admin:vajra_secure_pass@localhost:5432/vajra_fitness?schema=public"
JWT_SECRET="your_super_secret_jwt_key_of_at_least_32_chars"
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"
TRUST_PROXY=0
SMTP_HOST=""
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER=""
SMTP_PASS=""
SMTP_FROM="Vajra Fitness <no-reply@vajrafitness.in>"
```

- The database is **PostgreSQL** (SQLite is not used). For local development run `docker compose up -d db` (see `docker-compose.yml`) or point `DATABASE_URL` at any Postgres instance.
- `JWT_SECRET` is enforced at startup to be at least 32 chars.
- `TRUST_PROXY` should be set to `1` (or the number of proxy hops) when deployed behind nginx / Cloud Run / a load balancer so rate limiting keys on real client IPs.
- SMTP is optional in development (links are logged to the console); **required in production** so activation and password-reset emails are delivered.

**Frontend (`frontend/.env`)**

```env
VITE_API_URL="http://localhost:5000/api"
```

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start PostgreSQL (or point `DATABASE_URL` at an existing Postgres):
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d db   # from the repo root
   ```
4. Set up the database schema:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## API Documentation

Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api` (set via `VITE_API_URL` / `PORT`).

### Authentication

- `POST /auth/register/vendor` — register a gym owner (creates an unapproved gym).
- `POST /auth/register/member` — register a member (`{ gymId, planId? }`), status PENDING.
- `POST /auth/activate` — set a password from a one-time activation link (`token`, `password`).
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` — email a password-reset link; `POST /auth/reset-password` — reset from the token.
- `POST /auth/login` — returns `{ token, user }`; also sets a `refreshToken` HTTP-only cookie.
- `POST /auth/refresh` — cookie-based; returns a fresh `token`.
- `POST /auth/logout` — clears the refresh cookie.
- `GET /auth/me` — current user profile (gym, plan, status, notifications).
- `POST /auth/change-password` — authenticated password change (verifies the current password).

All protected routes expect `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The access token lives 15 minutes; the refresh cookie 7 days.

### Roles & access

`SUPER_ADMIN` manages the whole platform; `GYM_ADMIN` owns one or more gyms; `TRAINER` and `STAFF` belong to a single gym; `MEMBER` belongs to one gym. Endpoints that take a `:gymId` verify that the gym owner is the caller (Super Admin bypasses). Member self-service routes verify the caller is the member, their gym owner, or a Super Admin.

### Public (no auth)

- `GET /gyms` — approved gyms with their active plans.
- `GET /plans` — active membership plans only.
- `POST /enquiries/gym/:gymId` — walk-in/online enquiry (public lead).
- `POST /enquiries/contact` — contact-page form.
- `GET /public/faqs`, `GET /public/testimonials` — CMS content.

### Gym Admin dashboard

- `GET|PUT /gym/my-branch` — the owner's gym profile.
- `GET /gym/:gymId/stats` — members/active/pending, revenue (total + this month), pending fees, check-ins today, trainers/staff/plans/notices.
- `GET /plans/admin/gym/:gymId` · `POST /plans` · `PUT /plans/:id` · `DELETE /plans/:id`
- `GET /members/gym/:gymId` · `POST /members/gym/:gymId` · `GET /members/:id` · `PUT /members/:id` (approve/activate) · `POST /members/:id/activation-link` (regenerate link)
- `GET /fees/gym/:gymId` · `POST /fees/gym/:gymId` · `PUT /fees/:id` (status) · `GET /fees/member/:memberId`
- `GET /fees/:id/receipt` — fee receipt PDF (member self, owner, or Super Admin).
- `GET /attendance/gym/:gymId` · `POST /attendance/gym/:gymId` (member check-in; validates gym membership).
- `GET /workouts/gym/:gymId` — all slips for a gym.
- `POST /workouts/member/:memberId` — assign a slip (admin or the gym's trainer).
- `GET /workouts/:id/pdf` — workout-slip PDF (authorized: self / trainer / owner / Super Admin).
- `GET|POST /staff/gym/:gymId` · `DELETE /staff/:id` — manage trainers/staff (activation link returned on create).
- `GET /enquiries/gym/:gymId` · `PUT /enquiries/:id` — leads.
- Memberships: `GET /memberships/gym/:gymId` · `POST /memberships/gym/:gymId` (create) · `POST /memberships/gym/:gymId/renew` · `GET /memberships/:id`. Auto-expiry of overdue memberships is handled by the `syncExpiredMemberships` job.
- Bookings: `GET /bookings/gym/:gymId` (manage all) · `PATCH /bookings/:id` (role-aware status update).
- Notifications: `GET /notifications/my` · `PATCH /notifications/read-all` · `PATCH /notifications/:id/read` · `DELETE /notifications/:id`.

### Member self-service

- `GET /members/my-profile` — own profile (gym + plan + status).
- `GET /workouts/member/:memberId` · `GET /fees/member/:memberId` — own slips/payments only (403 for cross-member access).
- `GET /memberships/my` — own memberships; `POST /bookings` — book a trainer; `GET /bookings/my` — own bookings.
- `GET /attendance/my` — own check-in history; `GET /notifications/my` — own notifications.

### Super Admin

- `GET /admin/analytics` · `GET /admin/gyms` · `PUT /admin/gyms/:gymId/approve|suspend`
- `GET /admin/users` · `PUT /admin/users/:id/status` — suspend/activate an account (`isActive`). Suspended users are blocked at login and via refresh.
- `GET|POST|PUT|DELETE /admin/cms/faqs` and `/admin/cms/testimonials`
- `GET /admin/support/tickets` · `PUT /admin/support/tickets/:id`
- `GET /admin/audit-logs`
- SaaS: `GET /saas/plans` · `POST /saas/plans` · `PUT /saas/plans/:id` · `DELETE /saas/plans/:id`
- SaaS subscriptions: `GET /saas/subscriptions` · `POST /saas/subscriptions` (assign plan to gym) · `PATCH /saas/subscriptions/:id` (status); gym owners use `GET /saas/my-subscription`.
- Reports: `GET /reports/gym/:gymId/stats` · `GET /reports/gym/:gymId/revenue?format=csv`.

### Mobile app pairing notes

- Use `POST /auth/login` then store `token`; attach it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- To keep sessions alive without re-login, hold the `refreshToken` HTTP-only cookie (or copy it from the login response's `Set-Cookie` and send it with `POST /auth/refresh`) and re-issue access tokens.
- All PDFs are streamed as `application/pdf` with `Content-Disposition: attachment` — save the response body to a file for offline use.
- The 401 → refresh → retry flow is already implemented in `frontend/src/services/api.ts`; mirror it on mobile for seamless re-authentication.

## Deployment Guide

### Production Build

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready to be served by Nginx, Vercel, or Netlify (or a static CDN). Serve it over HTTPS and point `VITE_API_URL` at your backend origin.

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm run build
```

The output will be compiled TypeScript in the `dist/` directory. Run it with `node dist/server.js`.

### Docker (recommended)

The repo ships a `docker-compose.yml` with PostgreSQL, Redis, and a hardened multi-stage backend image (non-root user, production-only dependencies, healthcheck, and automatic `prisma db push` on first boot).

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Before going live:
- Replace `JWT_SECRET` in `docker-compose.yml` / your environment with a 64-char random value (`node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('hex'))"`).
- Configure `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` so activation and password-reset emails are delivered.
- Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your deployed frontend origin.

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] HTTPS everywhere (terminate TLS at the proxy/CDN; HSTS via the proxy).
- [ ] Strong random `JWT_SECRET` (≥32 chars) and strong Postgres + Redis passwords (never the docker-compose defaults).
- [ ] `TRUST_PROXY=1` set behind nginx / Cloud Run / a load balancer.
- [ ] Real SMTP credentials configured (activation + password-reset emails).
- [ ] Scheduled database backups (`pg_dump` cron or a managed Postgres with automatic backups).
- [ ] Switch from `prisma db push` to `prisma migrate deploy` for reproducible production schema changes.
- [ ] Monitoring/alerting on `/api/health` and error logs; log rotation on the runtime.
- [ ] For multi-instance scale-out, move the login brute-force lockout and rate-limit state to Redis (currently in-memory, single-instance).
- [ ] Keep the access token in memory in the browser (refresh token is already an httpOnly cookie); rotate the access token after any XSS concern.

### Auth & Security notes

- Passwords are hashed with **argon2** (legacy bcrypt `$2` hashes are auto-migrated on login).
- **Refresh tokens are stored hashed (SHA-256) in PostgreSQL, rotated on every refresh, and reuse of an old token revokes the entire session family.** Logout and password change revoke outstanding tokens immediately.
- Login brute-force protection: per-IP rate limiting + per-email lockout after 5 failures.
- All API routes use Zod validation; no raw SQL is used (Prisma parameterizes all queries).
- Super Admin routes are fully isolated behind a `SUPER_ADMIN`-only guard; gym-scoped and member-scoped routes verify ownership (no IDOR).
